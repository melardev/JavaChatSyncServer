# Introduction
Simple Chat application with UI I have implemented several years ago
when I was learning socket programming I just refactored it a little bit to make
it ready to be published on Github, so there are still a lot of missing things.
The network code is synchronous and uses serialization, for security reasons nowadays
using serialization in Java it might not be a good idea from a security point of view.

The Client can be found [here](https://github.com/melardev/JavaChatSyncClient)

# TODO
- The Console based Ui is not fully implemented.
